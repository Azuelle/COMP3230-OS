user: What is Fibonacci Number?

A fascinating topic!

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...). This sequence is named after the Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci, who introduced it in the 13th century.

The Fibonacci sequence is often represented as the sequence 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... (note the parentheses). This sequence is known for its unique properties, which have led to its widespread use in mathematics, art, and architecture.

**Why is the Fibonacci sequence important?**

The Fibonacci sequence has several important properties:

1. **Uniformity**: The sequence is always an integer sequence, meaning that each term is the sum of the two preceding terms.
2. **Uniformity**: The sequence is approximately equal to the golden ratio, phi (φ), which is approximately 1.61803398875.
3. **Uniformity**: The sequence is a geometric sequence, meaning that each term is<|im_end|>
